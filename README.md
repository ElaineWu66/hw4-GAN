# CS 449 Deep Learning Homework 4

The due date for this assignment is posted on Canvas. There are 22
points possible (2 for setup, 20 for your answers in the notebook). This
assignment is worth approximately 8% of your final grade.

This assignment can be completed in **groups of two**. If you need to find a
partner, please post in the pinned note on Piazza. To invite your partner to
your group, please go to the "Settings" page on GitHub, and click on
"Collaborators and Access" on the left-hand toolbar. If you are in a repository
named hw4-myusername, then this should bring you to a url like
"https://github.com/cs449f23/hw4-username/settings/access." Then, click
"Add people" and add your teammate to your repository. Please give them
"Write," "Maintain," or "Admin" access.

## Academic Integrity

Once you have formed your groups, the work you submit must belong only to your
group members. All group members must contribute to the work submitted; if
necessary, we may give group members different grades based on their relative
contribution. Do not submit another team's work as your own, and do not allow
another team to submit your work as their own.

If you use resources you find online, you must cite those in your notebook. If
we find sufficiently suspicious similarities between your answers and those of
another group, all students involved may be reported for a suspected violation.
If you're unsure of the academic integrity policies, ask for help; we can help
you avoid breaking the rules, but we can't un-report a suspected violation.

By pushing your code to GitHub, you agree to these rules, and understand that
there may be severe consequences for violating them.

## Important instructions

To submit this assignment, you should commit to your GitHub repository:

* your Net ID(s) in the `netids` file; one per line. Please do not put your name
  in your notebook; we will grade these anonymously.

* a `hw4.pdf` printout of the completed notebook that shows all your answers.

* your final `hw4.ipynb` notebook with outputs saved. If we run your notebook
  from scratch, it should produce an output (almost) identical to your PDF. You
  can edit your notebook however you want (on Colab, on your local machine,
  somewhere else); just upload the latest version of it to GitHub.

Your GitHub repository must submit contain all three of these, or you will lose points.

## Late Work

In general, late work is not accepted. The autograder will only download work
from your repository that was pushed to GitHub before the deadline. However:

- Each student gets three late days to use across the entire quarter. If you
  want to use late days, put the number of late days you are using in the
  `LATE_DAYS` file. Currently, that file contains the number 0. If you want to
  use one late day, replace it with the number 1.
- **NOTE**: If you are working with a partner, both you and your partner must
  have a late day available for the two of you to use a late day.
- If you have a personal emergency, please ask for help. You do not have to
  share any personal information with me, but I will ask you to get in touch
  with the dean who oversees your student services to coordinate
  accommodations.

## Need help?

Please post a question to Piazza. We'll get back to you there. If you are
sharing any content from your answers, please make that post private.
